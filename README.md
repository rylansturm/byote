"Build-Your-Own Text Editor" or "Bring-Your-Own Text Editor"

I don't know. I saw a Computerphile video about text editors
and gap buffers and thought it would be a fun project.

I'm not sure what keybindings I'll go with. Probably some
weird mix of vi and vs code. I like ctrl+w to close tabs...
ctrl+tab to switch between open editors. But navigation with
hjkl. Maybe I'll make it ctrl+hjkl so I don't need to do the
mode switching. Sounds obnoxious. For now, let's just get a
basic text editor working.
